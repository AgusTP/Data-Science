### Supervised Learning

### :moneybag: [Demand Forecasting.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AgusTP/Data-Science/blob/master/Purchase%20classification%20algorithms/Social%20network%20product%20purchase.ipynb)
*Classification algorithm.* 
Exploratory data analysis to evaluate the demand of a given product advertised on a social network, taking into account features such as age, gender and salary of a person. Different classification models, comparing metrics to evaluate precision. CAP and ROC curves.

### :car: [Cars price sale.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AgusTP/Data-Science/blob/master/Audi_price_Kaggle_Task/Audi_Kaggle_price%2896%25%20Score%29.ipynb)
*Regression Algorithm. Feature selection.*
The dataset contains different Audi car models, their year, transmission type and fuel type among others. Dataset EDA and diverse regression model comparison (Lineal, Lasso, SVR, Decision Trees, etc). SelectKBest feature selection algorithm to obtain the number of features to use. 

### :notebook: [Scholarship admission.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AgusTP/Data-Science/blob/master/Admission%20prediction/Admission%20Prediction.ipynb)
*Algoritmos de regresi√≥n. Model tuning.* 
EDA and data visualization to predict a scholarship admission percentage, given different exam scores. K-Fold Cross Validation to estimate the skill of the model on new data and GridSearch for model tuning.

### :tropical_fish: [Fish weight prediction.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AgusTP/Data-Science/blob/master/Fish%20weight%20analysis/Fish_weight_prediction.ipynb)
*Regression algorithms.*
Data containing diverse fish measurements visual analysis. Multiple linear regression assumptions check: Multicollinearity, normal distribution of features, linearity and homoscedasticity. Polynomial regression and Random Forest assembled model comparison. Outlier analysis with IQR method.

### Unsupervised Learning

### :barber: [Customer clustering.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AgusTP/Data-Science/blob/master/Clustering%20comparison/Mall%20Customers%20Clustering.ipynb)
*Clustering algorithms.*
EDA and clustering models comparison (K-Means, Hierarchical, Affinity Propagation and DBSCAN). All 2D and 3D plots where made with Plotly to enhance conclusion experience.

### Deep Learning

### :bank: [ANN classification.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AgusTP/Data-Science/blob/master/NN%20classification/ANN%20.ipynb)
*Neural Network.*
EDA and data visualizations. The dataset contains information about bank clients. Detailed explanation of every ANN step: input, output and hidden layers, optimizers, loss functions and weight initializers. Precision of the model and ROC and AUC curves.

### NLP

### :fork_and_knife: [Restaurant sentiment analysis.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AgusTP/Data-Science/blob/master/NLP%20reviews/NLP%20review%20analysis.ipynb)
*Sentiment Analysis.*
Restaurant review analysis, using Baf of Words model to classify positive and negative reviews. Word tokenization, text normalization and cleaning (explained). Unigrams, bigrams and trigrams plots. Wordcloud use.

### Associaton Rule Mining

### :hamburger: [Apriori for market products.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/AgusTP/Data-Science/blob/master/Association%20rule%20learning/Association%20Rules.ipynb)
Apriori algorithm to identify underlying relations between market products. This model, as well as Eclat and Fp-growth among others, are powerful tools for association rule mining.

### EDAs
